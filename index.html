<h2>About Me</h2>
    <p>
        I was born in Ottawa in the 2000<sup>th</sup> year. Growing up I was interested in digital mediums and would try to teach myself how to make make videos and make digital art. I've always wanted to learn how to write code so this class is very exciting for me.
    </p>
    <p>
        When I was in highschool, I took a communications technology class which reintroduced me to digital design as an adult. This class reignited my interest in design and digital technology and is what inspired me to take the <em>Interactive Media Design</em> program at <abbr title="Algonquin College">AC</abbr>.
